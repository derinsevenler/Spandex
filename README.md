## Overview

SPANDEX is the repository for all SP-IRIS related scripts and functions. It has three major sections:

1. Acquisition scripts: These are .bsh (beanshell) scripts that control the microscope to perform complex acquisition tasks.

2. Particle counting plugins: These are ImageJ plugins, written in Java, which perform particle detection on images using multi-step algorithms.

3. Analysis: These are programs or scripts written in MATLAB (or other languages) which allow one to analyze the results from (2). For example, this may include integration with .gal files to count particles in many spots across a large field-of-view, or registered counting of particles in a video as they bind and un-bind.
